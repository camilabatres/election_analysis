## Overview of Election Audit 
Assisted a Colorado Board of Election Employee in a election audit of the tabulated resutls for U.S Congressional precinct in Colorado. Through the use of python, I was able to analyze the data and calcualte the total number of votes casted, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate. By referring to the codes used to find out the each candidate vote, I was able to calculate the votes in each county and the largest county turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary 
* The Colorado Board of Elections can use this script for future elections where they can find out the main information: candidate's votes/percentages, winning candidate, and county's total votes/voting percentage. This way they can save up time and resources. 
* Other states can use this script becasue it is effective with any state's voting data. 
* They can also use this script to find out what counties need more attention with registering more voters.
