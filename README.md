## Overview of Election Audit 
Assisted a Colorado Board of Election Employee in a election audit of the tabulated resutls for U.S Congressional precinct in Colorado. Through the use of python, I was able to analyze the data and calcualte the total number of votes casted, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate. By referring to the codes used to find out the each candidate vote, I was able to calculate the votes in each county and the largest county turnout.
